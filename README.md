**Sales_Data_Analysis**

Business Analytics project to perform Extract transform and Load operations, analyze Amazon sales records and establish meaningful relationships between them for deriving useful statistical insights.

**Problem Statement:**

Sales management has gained importance to meet increasing competition and the need for improved methods of distribution to reduce cost and to increase profits. Sales management today is the most important function in a commercial and business enterprise. We need to extract all the Amazon sales datasets, transform them using data cleaning and data preprocessing and then finally loading it for analysis. We need to visualize sales trend month-wise, year-wise and yearly-month wise. Moreover, we need to find key metrics and factors and show meaningful relationships between attributes.

**Abstract:**

A sales report, also known as a sales analysis report, consolidates information about a business's sales activities, encompassing metrics such as sales volume, leads, new accounts, revenue, and costs over a specific period. It evaluates each stage of the sales funnel, shedding light on the performance of the sales team and pinpointing any potential gaps. These reports play a crucial role in refining sales strategies and broader growth initiatives. Using PANDAS, MATPLOTLIB, and SEABORN tools, this study conducts an extensive analysis of Amazon sales, presenting vital insights derived from the provided dataset. Leveraging these tools enables a comprehensive exploration of sales methodologies, predictions for future sales trends, performance comparisons with previous periods, and a deeper understanding of customer motivations.

**Approach:**

The main goal of the project is to find key metrics and factors and then show meaningful relationships between them based on different features available in the dataset.

Data Collection : Imported data from various datasets available in the project using Python libraries.

Data Cleaning : Removed missing values and created new features as per insights.

Data Preprocessing : Modified the structure of data in order to make it more understandable and suitable and convenient for statistical analysis.

Data Analysis : Started analyzing dataset.

Data Visualization : Used pandas, Matplotlib and seabird for data visulization.

**Tools Used:**

Python libraries like pandas, numpy, matplotlib and seaborn are Used.
